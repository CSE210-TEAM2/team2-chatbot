Reproductive Health









Reproductive Health Services
Reproductive Health Services offers confidential, accessible, compassionate reproductive health care to UC San Diego students. 
Experienced nurse practitioners and physicians provide birth control, emergency contraception, cervical cancer screening, breast exams, STI testing and treatment, gynecology problem visits, UTI visits, pregnancy testing and options counseling including medication abortion, vaccines, and sexual health support. 
We specialize in helping you choose the best contraceptive option for you. Students have access to a wide range of birth control methods, including IUD’s, the implant, contraceptive pills, patches and rings, Depo Provera, barrier methods, and emergency contraception. 
Sexual health information sessions are available for anyone interested in learning more about the reproductive system, contraception, and STI’s. We strongly recommend that students who have never had contraception counseling and/or a gynecological exam review the Sexual Health Info PowerPoint prior to their visit.
Pregnancy and STI testing is available at the SHS lab without an office visit. Lab appointments for this testing can be scheduled through MyStudentChart. Most lab testing is free for students with UC SHIP; modest lab fees are charged for those who have waived UC SHIP. 
Referrals for specialty gynecologists, obstetricians and midwives, physical therapy, and reproductive imaging are arranged as needed. Additional counseling and support services are available with student health clinical social workers and psychologists, UCSD Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), and the CARE at Sexual Assault Resource Center.

Pregnancy Options
Understanding your options is important when making decisions about planned and unplanned pregnancies. Pregnancy options include:

Prenatal Care by referral
Medication Abortion at Student Health Services or by referral
Aspiration Abortion by referral

Schedule an appointment online using MyStudentChart or call (858) 534-3300 with the Nurses’ Clinic for a pregnancy test or to explore pregnancy options.
If you have a positive pregnancy test and would like to schedule a medication abortion appointment at Student Health Services, please call (858) 534-2669 to schedule an appointment.
Medication Abortion Services
Medication abortion services are available at Student Health Services for pregnancies up to 70 days (10 weeks) gestation. This procedure can be scheduled by calling Group 4 at 858-534-2669.
For students with UC SHIP, there is no cost for medication abortion services at Student Health.
For students without UC SHIP, the fee for medication abortion services is $550.00. This fee includes the initial visit, ultrasound, medication, and 2-week follow-up visit.
Emergency Contraceptive Pill
The emergency contraceptive pill (ECP), often referred to as “Plan B” or the "morning after pill", is a method of preventing pregnancy from occurring after an incident of unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure (i.e., condom breaks, etc.). The emergency contraceptive pill works by delaying ovulation.
ECP is for emergencies only. Using ECP is less effective at preventing pregnancy than using birth control that is used before or during sex (e.g. birth control pills, condom, etc.). ECP is not the abortion pill. If you are already pregnant, ECP will not cause an abortion.
For more information or to obtain a prescription for ECP, please contact Student Health via MyStudentChart “ASK A NURSE”, or by calling Student Health at 858-534-3300, or the Group number for your Primary Care provider. You will be directed how to obtain the prescription.
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, frequently referred to as PCOS, is a common endocrine problem which globally affects 6-10% of reproductive-age people with ovaries. Common features of PCOS include irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism (e.g., acne, coarse hair growth, scalp hair loss). Treatment is focused on menstrual cycle control, treatment for acne, hair growth, and scalp hair loss as well as lowering cardio-metabolic risk through healthy eating and regular exercise.
Cervical Cancer Screening
Cervical cancer screening is done by a medical care provider through a PAP test recommended beginning at age 21. This test is used to detect abnormal cells in the cervix. You should discuss whether a PAP test is appropriate for you. We strongly recommend that students who have never had a gynecological exam review the Sexual Health Info PowerPoint prior to their visit.
Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the United States. HPV vaccines can prevent some of the negative health effects HPV causes (i.e., cervical, anal, genital, head/neck cancers). Vaccinations are available at Student Health Services. Schedule an appointment online using MyStudentChart or call (858) 534-3300 to schedule with the Nurses’ Clinic.
STD Facts - Human papillomavirus (HPV)
Breast Health
The first clinical breast exam (done by a medical provider) is recommended at age 25. It is important to be familiar with your own breast tissue as you are the best person to detect changes.
If you have any of these changes listed below, please see a medical care provider as soon as possible. You can call Student Health at (858) 534-3300 or the group number for your Primary Care provider.

A lump or swelling
Skin irritation or dimpling
Nipple pain or the nipple turning inward
Redness or scaling of the nipple or breast skin
A discharge other than breast milk
