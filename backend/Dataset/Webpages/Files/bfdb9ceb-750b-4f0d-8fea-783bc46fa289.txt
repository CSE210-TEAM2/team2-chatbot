Emergency Care









Emergency Care
Emergencies: If you are experiencing a life-threatening emergency, dial 9-1-1.If it is after hours and you would like to speak with a nurse, dial the main number (858) 534-3300 and select the option for the "Advice Nurse."
Rape, Sexual Assault and Personal Safety
If you or a friend are a victim of rape, sexual assault or are experiencing personal safety concerns, contact CARE@SARC​, the campus advocacy and education office for sexual violence and gender-based violence (dating violence, domestic violence, stalking). CARE@SARC provides violence prevention education for the entire UCSD campus and provides free and confidential services for students, staff, and faculty impacted by sexual assault, relationship violence, and stalking.
Where To Go for Urgent Care or Emergency Care

When Student Health is closed, urgent or emergency medical care is available from urgent care facilities and hospital emergency departments in the nearby community. 
If your symptoms are not life threatening, you should seek care from an Urgent Care facility. This would be most cost-effective and provide you with timely care. See "Urgent Care Center Locations" below for a list of nearby facilities. You are urged to call the facility ahead of time to verify their participation in UC SHIP.
For UCSD students with UC Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP):

Student Health Video Visit:  MyChart Video Visits (PDF) allows you to have a virtual appointment with a provider using your SmartPhone or Tablet and the MyChart App. Cost for students with UC SHIP or RAFT: $0; students without UC SHIP/RAFT:  fee-for-service same as a primary visit.
Urgent Care: UCSD Health Urgent Care, at Villa La Jolla Drive & Holiday Court — call for hours (858) 249-6800. Copay for UC San Diego Urgent Care is $25.00. Non-UCSD Urgent Cares have a $50.00 copay.
Emergency Care: Hillcrest—UC San Diego Medical Center, La Jolla—Jacobs Medical Center, or College Area—East Campus Medical Center. Copay with UC SHIP: $125.00
CVS Minute Clinic: The student needs a prior referral from SHS, and there is a nurse charge that is not covered, but the immunizations will be covered at 100%.
UCSD Health Express Care: The student needs a prior referral from SHS.
Immunizations at CVS Pharmacy (not in the Minute Clinic setting): The charges for immunizations will be billed to Anthem and paid at 100%. Bring your insurance card, no referral is required.

For UCSD students who have waived out of UC SHIP or have RAFT:

Check with your private insurance plan to see where emergency care is covered. RAFT is not an insurance plan, it only pays for care provided within the UCSD Student Health clinic, not the Emergency Room.

​Remember, i​nsurance coverage for after-hours care varies according to your health insurance plan. Some plans pay for elective after-hours care while others cover emergencies only.

What to do AFTER an Emergency Room visit
Helpful information "After You've Been to the Emergency Room (PDF)" about campus resources you may need. Included are: Student Health, UC SHIP, Deans' Offices, Res Life, Psych & Counseling Services, Disabled Student Services, and Sexual Assault & Violence Prevention.
Fees for Students With ​​UC SHIP

In-network Urgent Care copay: $50.00
Emergency Room patient copay: $125.00
Out of network Urgent Care covered 60% after $1,000 deductible (patient responsibility)

Doctors do leave Anthem's network from time to time. There may be higher fees associated for a doctor who is not in Anthem's network or for services not covered by SHIP. You may be responsible for those costs. To avoid higher fees, we recommend that you call Anthem at (866) 940-8306 prior to seeking services with any provider.
 Insurance coverage for after-hours care varies according to the student's health insurance plan. Some plans pay for elective after-hours care while others cover emergencies only.
Insurance Information
 The Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP) covers after-hours care for emergencies only. UC SHIP requires a written referral from SHS staff for non-emergency care. Follow-up care at an Emergency Room also requires a written referral from SHS staff. A referral from an Emergency Room doctor is not a valid referral. Please refer to the UC SHIP brochure for plan limitations and exclusions.​
You can speak with a Student Health Insurance Coordinator at (858) 534-2124 during business hours, or visit the insurance web page.

Any time Student Health Services is closed, you can call our regular telephone number (858) 534-3300 and select option #1,  "After Hours Advice" to speak with a registered nurse who will assist you in obtaining the appropriate care.
