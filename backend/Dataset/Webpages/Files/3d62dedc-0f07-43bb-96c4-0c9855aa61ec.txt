Call SHS Group 3 to schedule an appointment at 858-534-5571.
Behavioral Health Services, provided by CAPS psychologists and psychiatrist for brief, focused, targeted care (e.g., insomnia, anxiety, adjustment to medical diagnoses, stress management, etc.) are also available at Student Health Services.
