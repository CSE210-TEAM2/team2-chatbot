General Info



What is “Telehealth” or “Telemedicine”?


Telehealth and Telemedicine are sometimes used interchangeably, and typically encompass the following:


Online Visits: Real-time, audio-video communication between physicians and patients that are in different locations. Tools include interactive videoconferencing using mobile health (mHealth) applications (apps) on a computer, tablet, or mobile device.
Remote patient-monitoring tools such as blood pressure monitors, Bluetooth-enabled digital scales, and other wearable devices that can communicate biometric data for review (which may involve the use of mHealth apps).
Verbal/Audio-only or written communication, including telephone conversations, emails, instant messages, faxes, and online questionnaires (often considered telehealth but not telemedicine)
