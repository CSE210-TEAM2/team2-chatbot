Clinical Laboratory
Services
SHS Clinical Laboratory is open during regular clinic hours and closed on university holidays. Last patient check-in is at 3:30pm. During extended hours last patient check-in is at 5:00pm.
An appointment with the lab is PREFERRED and can be made on MyStudentChart.
Our Clinical Laboratory supports our clinicians' diagnoses through testing and analysis of patient specimens. 
Self-Directed Testing for sexually transmitted infections is available at Student Health by scheduling on MyStudentChart. Read more about STI testing.

The laboratory is licensed by the State of California and the Clinical Laboratory Information Act (CLIA). We are also accredited by the Accreditation Association of Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC).
The SHS laboratory can perform many tests in-house, including: complete blood counts, chlamydia, gonorrhea, respiratory testing, pregnancy testing, and urinalysis. Some laboratory tests must be sent to an outside laboratory (Quest Diagnostics).
Charges
There is no charge for medically-indicated tests for students with UC SHIP coverage. For students who have waived UC SHIP insurance, there is a lab processing fee, and modest charges for individual tests (see the  Cost of Services page).
Fasting Instructions
Fasting is required prior to some laboratory tests. Fasting means no food, drink (other than water), or gum for 10-12 hours prior to the test. Routine medications may be taken with water. DO NOT FAST BEYOND 14 HOURS.​
