Cost of Services









Cost of Services — For Registered Students
​​​​Charges can be billed directly to student accounts unless paid by credit card at the time of service. Please note, "Fee-for-Service" charges for elective procedures and graduated students (for one​ quarter after graduation) will vary depending on services rendered. For information about Automated Billing to student accounts, see Billing.
Reciprocal Services for Students From Other UC Campuses
All UC registered students are eligible to receive healthcare services at any UC Student Health Center systemwide.

Visiting UC SHIP enrolled students may receive all health center services at the same fees as a UC SHIP enrolled student registered on that campus. 
Visiting students not enrolled in UC SHIP may receive all health center services at the same fees as non-UC SHIP students registered on that campus. 
The UCSD Department of Extended Studies students that have SHIP through their enrollment & will be payer classified under the SHIP pricing and their claims will be submitted to the insurance plan for payment processing. 
The UCSD Department of Extended Studies students that waive their SHIP offering will receive pricing under the International Program Enrollees column. 

Current Costs: Fall 2023 through Summer 2024
Note: Costs are approximate and are subject to change.
