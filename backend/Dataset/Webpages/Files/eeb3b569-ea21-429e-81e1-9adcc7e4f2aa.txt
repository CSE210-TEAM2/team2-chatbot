Frequently Asked Questions
General Information



When is SHS open?


            Student Health hours are listed here.​
        

Where is Student Health?


SHS is located on Library Walk, west of the Price Center, south of Geisel Library.
Mail Address: UCSD Student Health (0039); 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093-0039
Telephone: (858) 534-3300 - Fax (858) 534-0814


Are the health services at SHS free?


Routine appointments are free for all registered students with UC SHIP. There is a co pay for Urgent Care. For students without UC SHIP insurance coverage, there are modest charges for laboratory tests, x-rays, and specialty appointments. See Cost of Services for more information.


Do I have to pay for services at SHS at the time I'm seen, or can I be billed later?


Depending on insurance and other criteria, there may be charges for some services/products at SHS. For the convenience of our patients, charges can be billed directly to their student account unless the student chooses to pay by credit card at the time of visit.


I do not have the University health insurance (SHIP). Can I still be seen at SHS?


All currently registered UCSD students can be seen at SHS, regardless of insurance coverage. There are fees for some services. See the Cost of Services page here.


I am an Extension student/ESL student/spouse of a student/staff/faculty. Can I be seen at Student Health?


SHS is for the exclusive use of full time, registered UCSD students, and certain others with specia​l arrangements. International/English Language Program students may be seen at Student Health at no charge for most services (exceptions are pharmacy, optometry, non-urgent immunizations, and elective laboratory tests). As Student Health is supported by student registration fees, we are unable to see other Extension students, staff, faculty, or family members.


How do I make an appointment at SHS?


To receive more personal service, you will need to choose a Primary Care Provider. You can choose your provider by calling (858) 534-3300. See the link above, "About Us" for biographies and photos. Once you have a Primary Care Provider, you can schedule appointments by calling your provider's group directly or by calling (858) 534-3300.
Remember to allow about one hour at the SHS clinic for check-in, visit with a provider, any labs, x-ray, or pharmacy items.
It is usually in the patient's best interest to stay with one health provider when there are any ongoing medical conditions. Our providers will make appropriate referrals to outside specialists.
General office visits are appropriate for most conditions. Routine annual gynecological exams require a longer appointment.
Same-day appointments for more urgent problems are available. Call your provider's group early in the day for best availability.
Urgent Care services are available on a walk-in basis. If you are not sure if Urgent Care is appropriate, call your provider's group for advice. Additional fees apply to Urgent Care visits for all students.
Administrative physical exams for employment, DMV, diving, or school applications should be scheduled with your Primary Care Provider. These exams require longer appointments and additional fees apply.
Refer to the Cost of Services for fee schedules.
Clinic services by appointment include:

Primary health care
General Appointments with physicians and nurse practitioners
Reproductive Health Services
Sports Medicine (by SHS referral only)
Travel Clinic
Nutrition Counseling



How do I make an appointment with a specific doctor?


To receive more personal service, you will need to choose a Primary Care Provider. You can choose your providers by calling (858) 534-3300. See the link above, "About Us" for biographies and photos. Once you have a Primary Care Provider, you can schedule appointments by calling your provider's group directly.


Do you have an Urgent Care if I have an injury?


Yes, SHS Urgent Care is available for medical emergencies and injuries. Additional Urgent Care fees apply.


How do I cancel an appointment?


When you are unable to keep a scheduled appointment, please call Student Health Services at (858) 534-3300 during business hours or go to MyStudentChart to self-cancel. Failure to cancel at least four hours prior to the scheduled appointment time will result in a no-show fee.


How do I know I will receive quality health care at SHS?


The SHS is accredited by the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC) and is staffed by licensed Physicians, Nurse Practitioners, Nurses, and Technicians. All of our physicians are board-certified either in Family Practice or Internal Medicine. The SHS staff are committed to helping students maintain healthy lifestyles.
Our goals are to:

Provide accessible, timely, primary care that is personalized, confidential, cost effective and meets the high standards of the Accreditation Association of Ambulatory Health Care.
Educate our students, emphasizing health promotion, healthy life styles, and lifelong disease prevention.
Assist the campus community in providing a supportive environment for students to pursue personal wellness.



Can I choose my health care provider?


Yes. You may specify which provider you would like to see when scheduling an appointment. See physician and nurse practitioner biographies and photos. If you have an ongoing health problem, it is usually preferable for you to stay with the same provider as much as possible, as they will already be familiar with you, and can best ensure a consistent medical plan.


How often should I have a general checkup?


Contrary to what many people think, most healthy young people do not need a regular physical examination or blood work. Routine recommendations for young adults are for blood pressure and weight checks about every 2 years, a cholesterol check every 5 years after age 35, annual STI testing and PAP test (every 3 years starting at age 21) if you are sexually active, and maintenance of current immunizations. Additional examination and lab testing may be indicated if you are having abnormal signs or symptoms, or have a personal or family history of certain medical conditions. You may make an appointment for a well check if you would like a review of your risk factors and health recommendations.


How can I see a specialist?


Most common medical conditions can be managed by a primary care provider at SHS. However, if specialist care is indicated, SHS providers can give you a referral to see other specialists within the local community. If you are enrolled in SHIP, you must have a referral by SHS in order to be covered by your insurance. If you have outside insurance, check your plan, as some will require a referral by your private primary care provider.


What are the procedures for Urgent Care? How much does it cost?


Students are seen on a walk-in basis in the order of medical urgency, not the order of arrival. There is a co-pay to be seen in Urgent Care. Check online for up-to-date fees.




Confidentiality



Will details of my medical care be kept confidential, even from my parents?


California state law and the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act of 1996 (HIPAA) protect the confidentiality of communications between health professionals and their patients. At SHS, we will not discuss information about you with others without your consent except as required by law. See link to consent information.


If my insurance is covered by a parent or spouse, how can I keep my information private?


If you are covered by a parent or spouse, use this link to register your desire to keep your medical information private: http://www.myhealthmyinfo.org/


I notice that there are student volunteers in the clinic. Will they read my chart and know about my medical condition?


Medical records are strictly confidential. Volunteers are not allowed to open or read your medical charts.


Where do I go to change personal information on my SHS account online?


On the main SHS web site, click on "Appointments". Log in with your PID and PAC and click on the "Profile" tab. There you can edit your local address, local phone number, and emergency contact.




Immunizations



What are the UCSD admission health requirements?


Read about the  Admission Health Requirements here.


What would happen to me if I don't complete the health requirement process?


If you do not complete the process, a hold will be placed on your registration for classes.


Can I get my Hepatitis B and Tuberculosis Assessment completed at SHS?


Yes. The 3-shot Hepatitis B series and tuberculosis screening can be completed by your family health care provider or at SHS. If you have started the series and want to finish at SHS, you need to bring documentation from your family provider specifying dates, etc., of previous Hepatitis B shots. The necessary forms for documenting your health requirements are available online.


I can't find my old immunization papers. What can I do?


You can try to obtain a copy of your immunization record from your high school or your pediatrician's office. If not obtainable, you may need to start the adult series of the vaccination over, or elect to be tested for immunity against measles, mumps, rubella, and hepatitis B by a simple blood test. You can walk in to the Nurses Clinic to discuss your questions, needs and options.


What are the recommended immunizations for college students?


Recommended immunizations are listed here. 


Can I get immunizations at SHS?


Yes, SHS has all basic and travel vaccines available. There are approximately a dozen vaccine-preventable diseases that can disrupt your college career. An RN visit and your immunization record from home is all you need to get your immunization status reviewed. SHS provides immunizations against the following contagious diseases: Chicken Pox, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, HPV (human papilloma virus) Influenza, Japanese Encephalitis*, Measles, Meningococcal Meningitis, Mumps, Pertussis, Pneumococcal Pneumonia, Polio, Rabies*, Rubella, Tetanus, Typhoid* and Yellow Fever*. (* requires a Travel Clinic appointment. All others are routine vaccines and can be obtained through Nurses Clinic on a walk-in basis)


Is the HPV vaccine available at SHS? How much does it cost?


Yes, Gardasil, the vaccine for human papilloma virus, is available at SHS. It is a series of 3 vaccines given over a 6 month period, and protects against the most common forms of HPV which can cause cervical cancer and genital warts. It is recommended for men and women ages 9-26. Check in at the Nurse's Clinic. See the Cost of Services page for current prices.




Flu



How much does the flu shot cost? Can I get it right away?


Please check on-line for up-to-date pricing and vaccine availability information. As long as supplies are available, you can get the flu vaccine at Nurses' Clinic. A schedule of special flu vaccine clinics will be published during Fall quarter.


My roommate has the flu. What do I do? 


Follow the basic flu prevention techniques: wash your hands frequently, do not touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, keep at least 6 feet distance from your roommate, frequently wipe down shared surfaces with disinfectant, and try to reduce stress levels, exercise, and get enough sleep. You can also suggest that your roommate wear a face mask to prevent spreading flu germs.


Can I get a flu shot during a regular appointment? 


No, you will need to walk in to Nurses' Clinic either before or after your appointment.


Is there a charge for a flu shot for those who have SHIP?


All students with UC SHIP can have the flu vaccine at no charge. There is a nominal fee for students with private insurance or with RAFT. See the Cost of Services page.




Sexual Health



Can I be tested for sexually transmitted infections at SHS?


Yes, you can make an appointment to be tested and treated for sexually transmitted infections.

If you do not have symptoms, you may schedule a routine appointment.
If you do have symptoms, you should see a provider as soon as possible, either in a same-day appointment, or through Urgent Care.

Cultures can be collected for sexually transmitted infections during a genital examination. Some diseases require urine or blood testing for diagnosis. Medication will be prescribed for any tests that are positive. SHS also provides education for preventing recurrence or partner transmission.


Does SHS do HIV testing? Is it confidential or anonymous?


Confidential HIV testing is done in the Nurse's Clinic. Check in at the front Registration desk and request "Counseling". This testing is confidential and the results are not released without your specific written consent. See the Cost of Services page for current prices.
Anonymous HIV testing is not available at Student Health. The San Diego Department of Health Services and other community clinics also offer free anonymous HIV antibody testing.


How can I get a prescription for birth control pills?


You can contact your primary care provider or call 858-534-2669 to schedule an appointment to be seen for birth control pills. If you have never taken birth control pills, we highly recommend that you check out the Sexual Health Info PowerPoint. This provides very useful information that can help you decide what type of birth control suits your needs. Having this information before your appointment will make your visit with your provider much more productive.


What if I forgot a birth control pill? What if I have forgotten 3 or 4?


If you forget one pill, and it has been less than 24 hours -- take it when you remember, then continue taking pills at your regularly scheduled time. You are still protected as long as this only happens once during a cycle.
If you forget one pill and it has been more than 24 hours but less than 48 hours, take it with your next pill (i.e. take both pills together) then resume your regular pill taking schedule. You can take 2 pills together anytime, but it is best to take them as soon as you remember. Your protection is probably diminished so it is recommended that you use a back-up method of birth control until the end of your pill cycle. It is common to have breakthrough bleeding if you miss pills.
If you completely skip pill-taking pills for more than 48 hours, do not try to catch up. Stop the pills. You will start your period a few days after stopping pills. It is best to talk to your clinician or an advice nurse to understand how to restart pills with the least interruption of your contraception. You are not protected and need to use a back-up method of birth control. If you had intercourse during the "missed pill days", call your clinician. You may benefit from ECP, emergency contraception pills.
If you have vomiting or diarrhea from the flu or excessive alcohol consumption, etc., pills may not be absorbed, which is equivalent to missing a pill. If possible, keep an extra pill pack just for these occasions. As soon as possible take the equivalent pill from this extra pack. If this is not possible or you continue to vomit or have diarrhea, use a back-up method until the end of the cycle. Contact a health care provider at SHS if you are uncertain about illness affecting your pill use.


When should I start having regular (annual) gynecological exams and PAP smears?


An annual gynecological exam at SHS consists of a general health history and physical exam, and a breast and pelvic exam. STI testing and a PAP smear may be done during the pelvic exam. Contraception may be prescribed during the annual exam. Annual exams should be performed within a year after first intercourse. Annual STI screening is recommended if you are sexually active. It is now recommended that women start having regular PAP smears (a test for cancer or precancerous changes of the cervix) at age 21, or 3 years after first intercourse. If you have never had a gynecological exam before, sexual health information sessions are available for anyone interested in learning more about the reproductive system, contraception, and STI’s. We strongly recommend that students who have never had contraception counseling and/or a gynecological exam review the Sexual Health Info PowerPoint prior to their visit.


How much does it cost to have a PAP smear?


See the Cost of Services page for current prices.


Can I get a pregnancy test done at SHS?


Yes. You will need to see a triage nurse. Check in at the main lobby reception desk. If the test is positive, you will be offered an appointment with a nurse to discuss options and obtain necessary referrals. See the Cost of Services page for current prices.


What is a yeast infection? What can be done for it? Can men get it from a girlfriend?


Yeast is an organism that is normally found in the vagina. Yeast overgrowth sometimes causes symptoms of itching and discharge, which is often referred to as a yeast infection. There are medications that can be prescribed after a diagnosis is made. If you are fairly certain your symptoms are due to yeast (you have been diagnosed with the same symptoms before), you may try an over-the-counter vaginal yeast cream. If your symptoms do not resolve after 3-5 days of using the cream, or if you have pelvic pain, bad odor, vaginal sores, fever or otherwise feel ill, your symptoms may be due to another type of infection and you must see your health care provider promptly. Occasionally yeast is transferred to a male through intercourse, but this is uncommon. Uncircumcised men are more likely to acquire a genital yeast infection.


Where can I get condoms?


Condoms are available for free using The Condom Concierge at Health Promotion Services (HPS). Condoms are also available in some dining halls like Earl's Place, and in the Campus Community Centers: Cross-Cultural Center, LGBT Resource Center, Women's Center, and other places on campus (Sunshine Market, etc.). Condoms can also be purchased online, and at drugstores and grocery stores off-campus.




Travel



Do you give travel advice?


Yes, we have a Travel Clinic where you can get up-to-date health advice and immunization prescriptions related to your destination. Certain immunizations require that you have a Travel Clinic appointment (Japanese encephalitis, rabies, typhoid, yellow fever, and malaria prevention pills) There is a charge for Travel Clinic appointments - call for your appointment: (858) 534-2918).


When should I schedule my travel appointment?


Since many immunizations require multiple doses, or must be given well in advance of travel (see immunization handout for schedule),we recommend you schedule your appointment at least 6 weeks prior to travel. Our travel appointments fill quickly in the Spring quarter, as many students are traveling abroad in the summer months, so it is best to call an additional 3-4 weeks before you need the appointment. Call Group I for your appointment: (858) 534-2918. See the Cost of Services page for current prices.




TB Testing



I need a TB test for my school or job application. How can I do this at SHS?


TB skin testing (PPD) is done through Nurse's Clinic on a walk-in basis. The test involves injecting a very small amount of antigen just under the skin in the forearm, then a reading of the test results in 2-3 days. PPD's cannot be placed on Thursdays, since we cannot read them on Saturday or Sunday. See the Cost of Services page for current prices.
If you had BCG vaccine (given in some foreign countries, but not the U.S.), you may have a false positive skin test. BCG offers only partial and temporary protection from TB, so you should still be tested. A blood test is now available at Student Health that is not affected by BCG.
If you have had a positive PPD skin test in the past, you should not have another skin test done. Instead, a blood test and/or chest x-ray is required to verify you do not have active tuberculosis. The nurse can order the x-ray for you.


My health care provider at SHS says I should take a medication because I have a positive skin test for tuberculosis. Why?


A positive skin test for TB means you have had exposure to the TB bacteria. If you have no evidence of active infection (confirmed by a review of your history, a physical examination, and a normal chest x-ray), you have what is a called a latent infection. You are not contagious to other people if you have a latent infection. Only about 10% of people diagnosed with latent TB ever develop active TB.
A medication called INH, taken for 9 months, is recommended for those with a positive PPD reading unless contraindication exists. The purpose is to treat the infection in its dormancy, thereby preventing it from becoming an active TB infection, a serious and contagious infection. For further information, see the CDC website www.cdc.gov/tb.




Lab Testing



How do I get my lab results? Can I get a copy?


Most test results are sent to you via secure e-mail. If you did not receive them, or if you would like an official copy, you may call or go to your provider's group where you had your appointment to get your lab results. You may also obtain a copy from Medical Records, once your provider has signed the results. Note: HIV test results can only be given in person. The laboratory staff cannot give you lab results.
If you were seen in Urgent Care, most providers have their main offices in one of the Groups (1, 2, 3 or 4) . Call the group directly for results. If your provider works in Urgent Care only (see provider list), call (858) 534-3302 and ask to be connected for results.
The groups keep a copy of test results for 2-3 weeks. After this, you can request a copy of results from Medical Records on the first floor of SHS (858) 534-2139. The laboratory staff cannot give you lab results.


I was told I need to fast before my lab work. What does that mean?


Certain lab tests require fasting for accuracy. These include fasting blood sugar, and cholesterol testing. Fasting lab work requires no food, drink (other than water), or gum for 12 hours prior to having your blood drawn. Routine medications may be taken with water.


How can I get a cholesterol check?


Cholesterol screenings are recommended every 5 years for males at age 35, and females at age 45. Testing may be recommended at an earlier age for certain people with a strong family history of high cholesterol, or those with certain other conditions such as diabetes or hypertension. You must fast for 12 hours prior to having your blood drawn. You will need to make an appointment with a health care provider to have your cholesterol screening ordered.


My private health care provider has requested I get lab work done. Can I have it done at SHS?


Yes. You will need a written lab order from your provider that includes the tests to be done and the frequency (if more than a one-time order), related diagnosis, the provider's name, address, phone, and fax number. Bring the order to the triage nurse (check in at the reception desk.)
If SHS did not refer you to the outside provider and/or you do not have SHIP insurance, there may be charges for lab work done at SHS.


Do you test for sexually transmitted infections?


Yes, you can make an appointment to be tested and treated for sexually transmitted infections.

If you do not have symptoms, you may schedule a routine appointment.
If you do have symptoms, you should see a provider as soon as possible, either in a same-day appointment, or through Urgent Care.

Cultures can be collected for sexually transmitted infections during a genital examination. Some tests require urine or blood samples for diagnosis. Medication will be prescribed for any tests that are positive. SHS also provides education for preventing recurrence or partner transmission.


Does SHS do HIV testing? Is it confidential or anonymous?


Confidential HIV testing is done in the Nurse's Clinic. Check in at the Registration desk and request "Counseling". This testing is confidential and the results are not released without your specific written consent. See the Cost of Services page for current prices.
Anonymous HIV testing is not available at Student Health. The San Diego Department of Health Services and other community clinics offer testing at San Diego County HIV Testing locations.


Can I get a pregnancy test done at SHS?


Yes. You will need to see a triage nurse. Check in at the main lobby reception desk. See Cost of Services for current fees.
If the test is positive, you will be offered an appointment with a nurse to discuss options and obtain necessary referrals.

The co-pay can be billed directly to the student's account or paid by credit card at the time of visit.


Where can I go to drop off a prescription?

Allergy Injections

SHS will no longer be accepting new allergy injection patients. Local allergist services are available at UCSD Perlman and Scripps. If you have SHIP, please schedule an appointment with one of our providers to obtain a referral.




Insurance



What is SHIP?


The Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) is a comprehensive health plan that provides a full range of medical coverage, including in/out patient services, specialty care, emergency care, hospitalization and mental health care, as well as dental and pharmacy coverage. Health Insurance is a mandatory non-academic condition for enrollment at UCSD. It ensures that (a) you will have access to medical care anytime you need it, (b) you will not experience a financial catastrophe in receiving the care you need and (c) you will have the help you need to avoid compromising your academic progress.
To ensure all students have adequate health care coverage and to satisfy the mandatory health insurance requirement, UCSD enrolls and provides SHIP coverage to all registered students each academic year.


Can I use my insurance to pay for prescriptions?


Students enrolled in SHIP may use their insurance to purchase prescriptions at the SHS pharmacy. See the current insurance brochure for co-pays. If you need to purchase a prescription outside of SHS, please review the information in the Insurance section of the Student Health and Well-Being Administration site.
SHS is unable to bill outside health insurance plans. Students not enrolled in SHIP may purchase medications at the SHS pharmacy, then submit the bill to their own insurance carrier for reimbursement. Students not enrolled in SHIP may also purchase medications at any community pharmacy.


I waived SHIP because I have private insurance, can I still use Student Health Services?


All students who pay full registration fees are entitled to use SHS, regardless of insurance. Physician and nurse practitioner visits are available at reasonable cost. However, students who are not enrolled in SHIP may incur additional charges for labs, x-rays and prescriptions. SHS does not bill private insurance.


I am not insured under SHIP but have private insurance. Can I be seen at SHS and have SHS bill my insurance directly?


We do not bill your insurance carrier. You would have to submit your receipt to your insurance carrier​.


How can I see a specialist?


Most common medical conditions can be managed by a primary care provider at SHS. However, if specialist care is indicated, SHS providers can give you a referral to see other specialists within the local community. If you are enrolled in SHIP, you must have a referral by SHS in order to be covered by your insurance. If you have outside insurance, check your plan, as some will require a referral by your private primary care provider.


How can I get more information about SHIP?


Please see the Insurance section of the Student Health and Well-Being Administration web site for more information.
