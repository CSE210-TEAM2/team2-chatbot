What if I Have Never Worn Contact Lenses, Can I Get a Prescription for Contact Lenses?

The contact lens training is a one on one training where one of our highly skilled team members will teach you how to safely and properly insert and remove contact lenses, as well as educate you on the proper care and cleaning of contact lenses.
