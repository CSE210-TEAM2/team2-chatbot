SHS Urgent Care and First Aid
Urgent Care/First Aid

Students may be seen on a walk-in basis for serious illness or injury that requires more immediate attention. Urgent Care visits are for concerns and issues that cannot wait for a regular appointment. Examples include chest pain or shortness of breath, possible broken bones, acute sprains, severe headache or other severe pain, nausea, vomiting, high fever, and cuts (including those that may need stitches). Patients with non-acute concerns will be triaged by a Registered Nurse and given an appointment. Refer to the Cost of Services page for applicable fees.
Urgent Care Hours
 
Hint: Urgent Care is least busy between 8:00am – 10:00am. Students who arrive during that time tend to be in the clinic for less than an hour, whereas students who arrive during the busiest time (afternoon) could have a 1-2 hour wait. Patients seen in UC may be taken in the order of the seriousness of their medical condition. There is a fee for Urgent Care, so check the Cost of Services page.

After Hours Nurse Advice Line
We have an After Hours Nurse Advice Line available. Any time Student Health Services is closed, you can call our main telephone number (858) 534-3300 and select the option "after hours advice" to speak with a registered nurse who will assist you in obtaining the appropriate care.
