When our clinic is running on time, we will do our best to accommodate a late arrival if you arrive within 5 minutes after your appointment time.
As a reminder, please provide at least a 4-hour notice when canceling or rescheduling your appointment to avoid the $20 cancellation fee. Letting us know in advance also assists with our clinical operations. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact SHS at 858-534-3300.

MyStudentChart Online Scheduling Tutorial


Video Visits With SHS Providers
You have the option of having a Video Visit which allows you to have a virtual appointment with a provider using your smartphone or tablet through the MyChart App. 

FREE with SHIP/RAFT; FFS ($39-159)
CALL to set a date and time for your video visit: (858) 534-3300 or go through MyStudentChart.
Follow the instructions to use MyChart: Video Visit procedures (PDF)

To give you more personal service, all students have been assigned to a specific Primary Care Provider (PCP).  You can also change your PCP at any time. Call your PCP's group directly to schedule appointments. See Medical Teams for profiles of our physician and nurse practitioner staff.
Remember to allow about one hour in the SHS clinic, including check in, visit with a provider, any labs, xray or pharmacy items.
If you must cancel a scheduled appointment, please do so at least 4 hours before the appointment time to avoid a "no show" fee. Call  (858) 534-3300 or self-cancel through MyStudentChart.

Tips and Tricks for Students Coming to SHS



Location


Our building is located on Library Walk directly opposite Target at the Price Center, South of Geisel Library.
TIP: If you type “UCSD Student Health Services” into Google Maps, you can obtain walking or driving directions to our exact location.


Calling Student Health


Our main line is (858) 534-3300. Please note, the main phone line can have a very high call volume.
TIP: Even if you do not know which Group or primary care provider you are assigned to, you are welcome to call any Group directly and we can assist or redirect you. The phone numbers are: 
Group 1: (858) 534-2918 (primary care and sports medicine)
Group 2: (858) 822-5926 (primary care and nutrition)
Group 3: (858) 534-5571 (primary care and behavioral health)
Group 4: (858) 534-2669 (primary care and reproductive health)  


Parking


 Student Health Services does not have on-site parking for patients. There are 4 reserved spots for severely ill or injured students on the Urgent Care (West) side of our building. To use these parking spaces, you must check-in through SHS Urgent Care and obtain a parking pass. Students without serious health conditions are not eligible to use these spaces.

Closest Parking: Gilman, Hopkins, and the South Parking Structure are the closest to our building. TIP: Be aware that parking is limited during the day, the Gilman structure usually fills up by 8 am. The South Parking Structure has the most available spaces for visitors. It can take more than an hour to find parking on campus after 10am, so consider catching the trolley or taking a bus if traveling to campus during the day.  
Purchasing a parking permit: You can purchase various types of permits online or through the ParkMobile app. TIP: the student permit (S) spots are very limited, but the visitor permit (V) spots are much more available and can be paid for by the hour. 



Public Transportation


The Trolley: The Blue Line of the San Diego trolley system stops at the UCSD Central Campus Station. From the trolley platform, walk directly West towards the Price Center and Library Walk to find our building.
Bus Lines: The following bus lines reach our campus: 30, 41, 101, 201/ 202, 237, 974, 978, 979. 


Prior to Your Appointment


Please complete your e-check in through MyStudentChart and sign all forms and fill out all questionnaires. TIP: download the MyChart app on your phone to make this process, as well as scheduling and messaging your doctor, much easier.
TIP: you are not “arrived” at your appointment until you enter your PID number on the tablets at SHS, or check-in in-person with the Group receptionist. The e-check in is for preliminary questions only.


Timing


Please show up 15 minutes prior to your appointment to make sure you find the correct location in our building and complete all forms and questionnaires. If you are 5 or more minutes late, we reserve the right to reschedule your appointment
No-Show Policy: If you miss your appointment, you are subject to a $20 no-show fee.


Online Scheduling


Online scheduling via MyStudentChart is available for non-urgent primary care or reproductive health visits.

If you are having issues scheduling online or feel your symptoms require prompt care, please call one of the Groups directly.
TIP: Not all types of appointments (e.g., travel visits, respiratory issues, procedures, video visits, mental health, etc.) can be scheduled online, so please call one of the Groups directly to be scheduled.



Urgent Care


We have Urgent Care in the same building on campus– the entrance is on the West side, doors facing away from the Price Center. Students may be seen on a walk-in basis for illness or injury that requires more immediate attention. UC visits are for concerns and issues that cannot wait for a regular appointment. Patients will be triaged by a Registered Nurse and given an appointment for on-acute concerns. Examples include chest pain or shortness of breath, possible broken bones, acute sprains, severe headache or other severe pain, nausea, vomiting, high fever, and cuts (including those that may need stitches).

TIP: Urgent Care is the least busy from 8am to 10am. 
Currently, students with UC SHIP insurance do not have to pay extra to be seen at our Urgent Care. For RAFT and non-UC SHIP students, refer to the cost of services for the Urgent Care fee. 
Weekend and after hours emergency and urgent care services are available from urgent care facilities and hospital emergency departments in the nearby community.
