Parking at SHS
SHS has very few patient parking spaces. The spaces we have are designated for severely ill or injured patients. The front desk will issue a patient parking pass when necessary.​ Students without serious health conditions are not eligible to use these spaces.
Most often there are no available parking spaces at SHS. Therefore, if you must come to SHS by car, please have a friend drop you off, and then ​pick you up after your visit at SHS.
