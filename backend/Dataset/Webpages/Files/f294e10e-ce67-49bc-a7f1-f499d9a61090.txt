Self Assessment Tools
Cold and Flu
Do you have cold or flu symptoms? Find out how to care for yourself or decide you need to visit Student Health using this Cold/Flu self-assessment.
Please ensure you complete your daily UCSD Symptom Screening, and be sure to indicate that you have symptoms and you will receive a call from a Nurse at the Triage Line, UC San Diego Health.
Please test via one of our on-campus vending machines and please await the result via MyStudentChart. To book a time for in-person or Drive Thru testing please schedule a time via MyStudentChart.
For self-care instructions please refer to the CDC - 10 Things You Can Do To Manage Symptoms (for possible or confirmed COVID-19).
After receiving results, if negative and symptoms are worsening please call Student Health at (858) 534-3300 or send a message to ASK A NURSE for advice in MyStudentChart. If positive please wait for a call from the Student Health COVID Team for directions.
Nutrition
Nutrition Counseling is available to all UCSD students.
What is Your Ideal Weight? A more accurate way to calculate what is truly a healthy weight range for you.
Mental Health
UCSD students can take this Online Mental Health Screening for depression, anxiety problems, eating disorders, and alcohol problems. It can help you decide if you have a problem and could benefit from talking to a counselor at Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) on campus.
Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs
e-CHUG and  e-TOKE are brief, on-line surveys that provide detailed assessment of your alcohol and marijuana use as compared to other UCSD students. The surveys are completely anonymous and no personal information is stored.
