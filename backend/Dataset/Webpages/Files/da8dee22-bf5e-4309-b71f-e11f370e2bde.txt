Health Requirements for Students
The health of the individual can affect the health of the campus community, and UC San Diego is committed to protecting the well-being of all our students. All incoming and re-admitted graduate and undergraduate students are required to meet the UC Immunization and Tuberculosis (TB) Screening Requirements.

To complete your Health Requirements, you will first need to activate your online health portal (using your Student AD) in MyStudentChart. Please see the MyStudentChart Instructions (PDF) for further explanation on the setup process. You can communicate with the Nursing team here also by going to Ask-A-Nurse in messages.

Please complete these requirements early to avoid delays. Clearance can take 7-10 days after receipt, so please start this process early! FAILURE TO COMPLETE REQUIREMENTS WILL RESULT IN AN INABILITY TO ENROLL IN CLASSES.
TB Risk Screening Questionnaire

Deadline for Fall 2023: July 10, 2023
All incoming students* are required to complete a TB Risk Screening Questionnaire.
For those at higher risk, TB testing will also be required. Risk is determined by the questionnaire. Take the TB Testing form to your Healthcare provider if you are directed to do so after completing the questionnaire.
*includes transfer, re-admission, and those transitioning from undergraduate to graduate
