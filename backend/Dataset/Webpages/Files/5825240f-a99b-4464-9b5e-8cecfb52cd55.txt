About Us

Welcome to UCSD!
Student Health Services (SHS) invites you to utilize our healthcare services for a variety of your medical needs. Our facility is located in the center of campus, just west of Library Walk and the Price Center Bookstore. All students paying registration fees have access to SHS. Our staff of physicians, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, optometrists, health educators, and other health care professionals is committed to helping students maintain healthy lifestyles. Most outpatient primary care medical services at SHS are provided to you at no cost while you are a registered student. Remember us when you need medical care, and best wishes for a healthy academic year.
-- Stacie J. San Miguel, M.D.,  Director of Medical Services​
