Service Animals and Emotional Support Animals
Service animals specifically trained to assist a person with a disability are welcome in the UCSD Student Health Services. In order to help maintain a pleasant, productive and safe environment for all patients and staff, service animals must be in the physical proximity of their handler and under handler control at all times.  Service animals may not be left unattended by their handler at any time.
No other animals, including pets, emotional support animals, or therapy animals are allowed.
UCSD SHS staff are permitted to ask patients with service animals to leave or reschedule their appointment if the service animal is disruptive or interferes with the operations of our health care organization. UCSD SHS staff are permitted to ask patients with pets or emotional support animals to leave.  We will reschedule the patient's appointments when the patient can return without the pet or emotional support animal.
UCSD SHS providers/staff will not write letters of support for emotional support animals.
