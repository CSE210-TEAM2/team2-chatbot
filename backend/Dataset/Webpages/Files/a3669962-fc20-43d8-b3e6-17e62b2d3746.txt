Winter Return to Campus
UC San Diego Health Services strongly recommends students take a COVID test at least 1-2 days prior to your return to campus. If you test positive for COVID, it is highly recommended you stay home to isolate and recover before coming back to campus. Please email your respective Residential Life office to inform them of your plan to return on a different day. For additional resources, please visit the COVID-19 Campus Resources and Guidelines website.
Excite Lab
Excite will be open as usual December 27 through December 29. Excite lab will be closed Monday, January 1 and Tuesday, January 2, in observance of campus holidays. There will be no processing of Covid PCR tests on these days. Excite lab will be open as usual on Wednesday, January 3, 2024. Rapid antigen testing should be used during times of laboratory closures. More info is available on the COVID-19 Campus Resources and Guidelines website.

Reporting Outside Positive COVID-19 Tests
Students who’ve tested positive using an at home rapid antigen test or outside of UC San Diego, should send results to SHS COVID Team through MyStudentChart (Menu>Communication>COVID Request).
