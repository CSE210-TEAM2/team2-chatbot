Nutrition Counseling
During academic quarters, nutrition counseling is provided by our Registered Dietitians. This service includes nutrition counseling based on individual needs and follow-up visits as necessary. In order to make an appointment with one of our dietitians, you will need a referral from your primary care provider at Student Health Services, your psychiatrist at CAPS, or a Health Educator in Health Promotion Services. To make the most of your appointment, please fill out the UCSD Nutrition Assessment located within your e-check in process at least 24 hours in advance. Check-in at the front desk on the first floor of Student Health.
There is NO FEE for registered students with UC SHIP and students with RAFT; non-UC SHIP and non-RAFT students pay $20 per visit. See the Cost of Services page for more detail.
