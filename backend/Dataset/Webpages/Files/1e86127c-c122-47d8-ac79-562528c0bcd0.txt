How to Fill a Prescription Written by a Non-SHS Provider


Prescriptions written by a healthcare provider outside Student Health can be filled at SHS by asking your healthcare provider to e-prescribe your prescription to UCSD Student Health Services Pharmacy or call (858) 534-2135.


How To Transfer an Existing Prescription From an Outside Pharmacy to the SHS Pharmacy


Call us at (858) 534-2135 during business hours and give us the name and phone number of the pharmacy and the name or prescription number of the medication. Allow 24 hours to transfer medications to our pharmacy.
Note, we only bill the SHIP insurance plan, so if you have private health insurance, you would pay the retail price and then submit a claim to your insurance company for reimbursement.


When Will My Prescription Be Ready for Pickup?


​We will call you only if there is a problem with refilling your prescription request. Otherwise your prescription will be filled in 24-48 hours.
You will be contacted by your provider through a secure message to your UCSD email address if you need to be seen by your provider, or if your provider has any questions for you.


Emergency Contraception


ECP is available without a prescription at the SHS Pharmacy. The cost is approximately $20.00 plus tax.


Over-The-Counter


Over-the-counter items such as cough and cold remedies, first aid supplies, lotions, ointments, contraceptives, and contact lens products are for sale at reduced student health prices.


Drug Formulary


If you have questions regarding the Drug Formulary or list of covered medications, please call Optum Member Services at (844) 265-1879. Optum is the UC SHIP carrier for pharmacy benefits.
As there may be some availability exceptions, please call and speak with one of our pharmacists if you have questions (858) 534-2135.
